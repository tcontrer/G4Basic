# G4Basic
G4Basic: Teflon study
To run geant on Odyssey, use these setup commands first (and every new login):
(source /n/holystore01/LABS/guenette_lab/Lab/software/next/scisoft/setup)
setup cmake v3_14_3
setup gsl v2_5 -q prof
setup geant4 v4_10_6_p01 -q e19:prof
setup root v6_18_04 -q e19:prof

To install:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

Whenever you edit the code you must rebuild (from the build directory):
cmake --build .

To Run (from build directory):
./app/G4Basic

Then you can to shoot a single photon:
/run/beamOn 1

To run a macro (here named testrun.mac) that tells how many photons to shoot, where, etc:
./app/G4Basic testrun.mac
